# While Loop

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use a while loop in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that takes inputs from the user until a negative number is entered.

-For example, the program will output:
```
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop):
9
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop):
8
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop):
0
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop):
-8
End
```

### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* Add your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
